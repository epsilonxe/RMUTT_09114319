Hereâ€™s the revised workshop with gentler introductions for each problem, including explanations where necessary:

# Workshop: Recursion in Action

## Objective

This workshop will help you:
- Understand and implement recursive functions step-by-step.
- Explore how recursion simplifies solving complex problems.
- Apply recursion to real-world scenarios.

The exercises include explanations to guide your understanding and build your confidence.

## Exercise 1: Recursive Sum of a List (20 minutes)

### Introduction:
The goal is to find the sum of all elements in a list. Recursion can simplify this by breaking the list into smaller parts:
- Add the first element to the sum of the remaining list.
- Stop when the list is empty (base case).

### Problem:
Write a recursive function to calculate the sum of all elements in a list.

### Function Signature:
```python
def recursive_sum(arr):
    # Your implementation here
```

### Example Input and Output:
```python
print(recursive_sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: 15
print(recursive_sum([]))              # Output: 0
```

---

### Suggested Solution:
```python
def recursive_sum(arr):
    if not arr:  # Base case: empty list
        return 0
    return arr[0] + recursive_sum(arr[1:])  # Recursive case

# Testing
print(recursive_sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: 15
print(recursive_sum([]))              # Output: 0
```

## Exercise 2: Recursive Palindrome Check (30 minutes)

### Introduction:
A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward (e.g., "radar" or "level"). Using recursion, you can:
- Compare the first and last characters of the string.
- Recursively check the remaining substring.
- Stop when the string is empty or has one character (base case).

### Problem:
Write a recursive function to check if a string is a palindrome.

### Function Signature:
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    # Your implementation here
```

### Example Input and Output:
```python
print(is_palindrome("radar"))  # Output: True
print(is_palindrome("hello"))  # Output: False
print(is_palindrome(""))       # Output: True
```

---

### Suggested Solution:
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    if len(s) <= 1:  # Base case: string is empty or a single character
        return True
    if s[0] != s[-1]:  # Compare first and last characters
        return False
    return is_palindrome(s[1:-1])  # Recursive case: remove first and last characters

# Testing
print(is_palindrome("radar"))  # Output: True
print(is_palindrome("hello"))  # Output: False
print(is_palindrome(""))       # Output: True
```

## Exercise 3: Towers of Hanoi (40 minutes)

### Introduction:
The Towers of Hanoi is a classic recursion problem. It involves moving \( n \) disks from a source rod to a target rod using an auxiliary rod, following these rules:
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk.
3. The goal is to move all disks to the target rod.

### Problem:
Write a recursive function to solve the Towers of Hanoi problem.

### Function Signature:
```python
def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary):
    # Your implementation here
```

### Example Input and Output:
```python
hanoi(2, "A", "C", "B")
# Expected Output:
# Move disk 1 from A to B
# Move disk 2 from A to C
# Move disk 1 from B to C
```

---

### Suggested Solution:
```python
def hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary):
    if n == 1:  # Base case: one disk
        print(f"Move disk 1 from {source} to {target}")
        return
    hanoi(n - 1, source, auxiliary, target)  # Move n-1 disks to auxiliary
    print(f"Move disk {n} from {source} to {target}")  # Move nth disk to target
    hanoi(n - 1, auxiliary, target, source)  # Move n-1 disks to target

# Testing
hanoi(2, "A", "C", "B")
```

## Exercise 4: Recursive Fibonacci (30 minutes)

### Introduction:
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones:
\[
F(0) = 0, \, F(1) = 1, \, F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \, \text{for} \, n > 1
\]
Example: \( 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, \dots \).

Using recursion:
- Base cases: \( F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1 \).
- Recursive case: \( F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \).

### Problem:
Write a recursive function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number.

### Function Signature:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    # Your implementation here
```

### Example Input and Output:
```python
print(fibonacci(5))  # Output: 5
print(fibonacci(7))  # Output: 13
```

---

### Suggested Solution:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:  # Base cases: F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
        return n
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)  # Recursive case

# Testing
print(fibonacci(5))  # Output: 5
print(fibonacci(7))  # Output: 13
```
