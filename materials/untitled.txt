# Workshop: Quicksort and Divide and Conquer

## Objective
- Reinforce understanding of Divide and Conquer techniques.
- Solve challenging problems to deepen knowledge of recursion and Quicksort.
- Apply concepts creatively to real-world scenarios.

---

## Problem 1: Find the Kth Smallest Element
### Problem:
Write a recursive function to find the **Kth smallest element** in an unsorted array using the Quicksort partitioning logic. Your function should not fully sort the array.

### Example Input and Output:
```python
arr = [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15]
k = 3
# Output: 7 (the 3rd smallest element)
```

### Hint:
- **Base case**: The array has only one element, and \( k = 1 \).
- **Recursive steps**: Partition the array into `left` and `right` subarrays based on a pivot. Recursively determine if \( k \) lies in the left subarray, the pivot itself, or the right subarray.

---

### Suggested Solution:
```python
def kth_smallest(arr, k):
    pivot = arr[0]
    left = [x for x in arr[1:] if x < pivot]
    right = [x for x in arr[1:] if x >= pivot]
    
    if k <= len(left):
        return kth_smallest(left, k)
    elif k == len(left) + 1:
        return pivot
    else:
        return kth_smallest(right, k - len(left) - 1)

# Testing
print(kth_smallest([7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15], 3))  # Output: 7
```

## Problem 2: Largest Square Plots
### Problem:
A farmer has a rectangular field with dimensions \( l \) and \( w \). They want to divide the field into the largest possible square plots. Use recursion to calculate the size of the largest square plot.

### Example Input and Output:
```python
length = 1680
width = 640
# Output: 80 (largest square plot size)
```

### Hint:
- **Base case**: If one dimension is 0, return the other dimension.
- **Recursive step**: Use the Euclidean algorithm: Reduce the problem to finding the largest square plot for \( \text{width} \) and \( \text{length} \% \text{width} \).

---

### Suggested Solution:
```python
def largest_square_plot(length, width):
    if width == 0:
        return length
    return largest_square_plot(width, length % width)

# Testing
print(largest_square_plot(1680, 640))  # Output: 80
```

## Problem 3: Count Inversions in an Array
### Problem:
An inversion in an array is a pair of elements such that \( arr[i] > arr[j] \) for \( i < j \). Use a Divide and Conquer approach to count the number of inversions in an array.

### Example Input and Output:
```python
arr = [2, 4, 1, 3, 5]
# Output: 3 (Inversions: (2, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3))
```

### Hint:
- **Base case**: If the array has 0 or 1 element, return 0 inversions.
- **Recursive steps**:
  1. Divide the array into two halves.
  2. Count inversions in the left half, the right half, and while merging the two halves.

---

### Suggested Solution:
```python
def count_inversions(arr):
    def merge_and_count(left, right):
        merged = []
        i = j = count = 0
        while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
            if left[i] <= right[j]:
                merged.append(left[i])
                i += 1
            else:
                merged.append(right[j])
                j += 1
                count += len(left) - i
        merged.extend(left[i:])
        merged.extend(right[j:])
        return merged, count
    
    def divide_and_count(arr):
        if len(arr) < 2:
            return arr, 0
        mid = len(arr) // 2
        left, left_count = divide_and_count(arr[:mid])
        right, right_count = divide_and_count(arr[mid:])
        merged, merge_count = merge_and_count(left, right)
        return merged, left_count + right_count + merge_count
    
    _, total_count = divide_and_count(arr)
    return total_count

# Testing
print(count_inversions([2, 4, 1, 3, 5]))  # Output: 3
```

---

## Problem 4: Sort Strings by Length
### Problem:
Write a function that uses Quicksort to sort a list of strings by their lengths in ascending order.

### Example Input and Output:
```python
arr = ["apple", "banana", "kiwi", "grape"]
# Output: ["kiwi", "grape", "apple", "banana"]
```

### Hint:
- **Base case**: If the list has 0 or 1 string, it is already sorted.
- **Recursive steps**: Partition the strings into `shorter` and `longer` based on the length of the pivot string, then recursively sort each partition.

---

### Suggested Solution:
```python
def quicksort_by_length(strings):
    if len(strings) < 2:
        return strings
    pivot = strings[0]
    shorter = [s for s in strings[1:] if len(s) <= len(pivot)]
    longer = [s for s in strings[1:] if len(s) > len(pivot)]
    return quicksort_by_length(shorter) + [pivot] + quicksort_by_length(longer)

# Testing
print(quicksort_by_length(["apple", "banana", "kiwi", "grape"]))  # Output: ["kiwi", "grape", "apple", "banana"]
```

---

## Problem 5: Closest Pair of Points
### Problem:
Given a set of points in a 2D plane, find the closest pair of points using a Divide and Conquer approach.

### Example Input and Output:
```python
points = [(2, 3), (12, 30), (40, 50), (5, 1), (12, 10), (3, 4)]
# Output: Distance between closest points: 1.41
```

### Hint:
- **Base case**: For 2 or 3 points, calculate distances directly.
- **Recursive steps**:
  1. Divide points into left and right halves based on their x-coordinates.
  2. Find the closest pairs in the left and right halves.
  3. Consider the closest pair across the dividing line.
